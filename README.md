# P5.js waves experience

## Introduction

This is a waves experiment, built with p5.js and TypeScript.

The project is built with Vite and deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

Enabled linting using ESLint and formatting using Prettier.

Was inspired by the article by [Hannah Yan Hansson](https://medium.com/@yanhann10/drawing-waves-with-p5-js-444f447bdc39). First experiment using perlin noise for rendering semi random shapes.

## Getting Started

To get started with development, you need to run the following commands.

```
nvm use
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Notes and caveats

-   Formatting and linting using Prettier and ESLint are not automatically executed before pushing or during the GitHub Actions workflow.
-   I think the results from the mentioned article are much nicer, but didn't want to resort to duplicating the code exactly.
